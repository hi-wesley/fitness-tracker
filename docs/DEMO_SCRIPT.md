# Demo Script (5–7 minutes)

## 0:00 — Problem
- “Most people have health data split across wearables, nutrition logs, smart scales, and at-home devices.”
- “That fragmentation makes it hard to answer practical questions like: *How does sleep affect cravings?* or *When should I deload training?*”

## 0:45 — Solution overview
- “This prototype has a static frontend dashboard (Vercel-friendly) plus a backend service (Hetzner-friendly).”
- “The dashboard unifies canonical health JSON into daily rollups; insights will be generated by GPT-5.2 via the backend (WIP).”

## 1:15 — Load data
Option A (fastest on demo machine):
- The sample dataset loads automatically on page load

Option B (bring your own data):
- Open the **Data** section
- Use **Upload JSON** (or paste JSON) and click **Analyze**

## 1:45 — Dashboard
- Point to the top dashboard panels:
  - Sleep, Physiological stress, Exercise, Nutrition, Blood pressure, Weight
- Show range toggles on a couple cards (e.g. Sleep 7D vs 30D).
- Hover a few days on the charts to show tooltips.

## 3:00 — Insights
- Point to the **Overall summary** card + one card per category (layout matches the dashboard).
- “These will be generated by GPT-5.2 from the unified daily rollups (implementation next).”

## 4:30 — Why this is useful (without jargon)
- “Instead of raw charts, this highlights what matters: short sleep streaks, elevated resting heart rate, and unusual swings.”
- “The goal is to help you make small decisions: protect sleep, adjust training load, and plan nutrition.”

## 5:30 — Tech + future enhancements
- “Frontend: static dashboard + charting. Backend: GPT-powered insight generation.”
- “Next steps: connector ingestion (HealthKit/Google Fit/MyFitnessPal), persistence, and evaluation for safe/consistent insights.”

## 6:30 — Wrap
- “The goal is a holistic view that turns raw numbers into actionable insights, personalized to each user’s baseline.”
