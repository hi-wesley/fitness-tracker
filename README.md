# Wellness Aggregator (Prototype)

Unifies sleep, nutrition, activity, and vitals into a single dashboard, with an insights layer that will be generated by GPT-5.2 (via a backend service).

## Architecture
- Frontend (this repo root): static HTML/CSS/JS (Vercel-friendly)
- Backend (`backend/`): Node/Express scaffold for Hetzner (OpenAI-powered insights; endpoints are still WIP)

## What’s included
- Dashboard (2×3):
  - Sleep (1/7/30)
  - Exercise (1/7/30)
  - Blood pressure (7/14/30)
  - Physiological stress (1/7/14; previous day)
  - Nutrition (1/7/30)
  - Weight (7/30/90)
- Insights UI scaffold:
  - Overall summary (top, full-width)
  - One insight card per category (layout matches the dashboard)

## Run locally
### Frontend
Use any static server. For example:
- `python3 -m http.server 5173` (or any port)
- `npx serve .` (requires Node + npm; often defaults to port 3000)

Then open the printed URL.

### Backend (optional; insights not wired yet)
- `cd backend`
- Add your OpenAI key to `backend/.env` (`OPENAI_API_KEY=...`)
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Verify: `curl http://localhost:8787/health`

## Data format
The app expects a canonical JSON payload with a `records` array (or a raw array of records).

- `data/sample-health-data.json`
- `docs/DESIGN.md`
- The schema block in `index.html`
